### What is a PPA provider?
PPA stands for "PAY PER ACTION". 
It allows anyone can distribute cash rewards to their community for completing ceartin actions (like a member voting on top.gg, a twitter follow, an instagram like, etc). It allows you to get **REAL** engagement while rewarding your userbase for helping you grow. It's a system where everyone wins, you get real engagement - and your community gets cash rewards in the form of the most popular stablecoins on crypto (like USDT or BUSD).
